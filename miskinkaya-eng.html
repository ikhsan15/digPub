								<div class="answer">
									<p>Rich and Poor According to The Qur’an</p>
									<p>
										Sometimes, someone’s position in society was depends on their economic level. We called it poor and rich. Someone with a low economic level was called poor and the one with huge money and wealthy was called rich. Society’s standard and definition of poor and rich were not suitable with The Qur’an. 
									</p>
									<p>
										“Rich and Poor According to The Qur’an” presented another perspective about honor in human life. Happiness, well-being, success, and achievement in someone’s life were not determined by their wealthy or occupation. This e-book was completed with verses from The Qur’an that contained information about poverty and riches. This e-book was suitable for people who think their life was so hard because of their poverty or people who think they were so great with their wealth. Allah SWT tells us what is the real poor and the real wealthy with The Qur’an through this e-book.
