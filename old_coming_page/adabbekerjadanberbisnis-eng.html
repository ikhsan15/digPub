									<p>Work and Business Etiquette</p>
									<p>
										In this modern era, the majority of us, both men and women,
										are required to have a job or a business (business). Various
										jobs and businesses are available in the field, and must be
										managed properly and optimally so that all types of work and
										business can continue to run within the syar`i corridor and
										provide beneficial benefits to all parties.
									</p>
									<p>
										This book is here so that readers can know and understand
										more about the adab (akhlaqiyat) that must be carried out,
										both by workers and business people. This book presents the
										various etiquette required by workers or business
										people—whether in working, managing a business,
										relationships with partners, or others—so that it is hoped
										that by understanding these adabs can eliminate the
										potential and risks of conflict that may arise due to a
										sense of injustice or conflict of interest between the
										parties involved in a business or business.
